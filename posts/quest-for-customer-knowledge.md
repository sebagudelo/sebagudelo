Research is a deep topic, and a quest for learning more about your customer and market.

Still, many businesses get this wrong. Here’s why.

Jumping straight to a focus group or a quick customer survey is missing the point.

From my perspective, starting with questions and assumptions is the most important thing to start the quest. The tactics follow from here.

## Questions

## Let’s get meta - Use questions to qualify your questions

What are the aspects of your industry which you can’t Google?

What are the unique perspectives to specific markets that rarely get written about?

What are the unspoken or implied commonalities between different people in different companies (B2B) or households (B2C)?

What are the beliefs that people adopt that influence their actions?

This is the gold dust. I often find, I don’t know what I don’t know.

By getting clear on the questions, I, at least, get started and then the surprises roll in along the way.

## Assumptions

> "Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in." 

Isaac Asimov

What an amazing quote that cements why assumptions are also vital to consider in research (and life).

How do you confirm what you know about your customer, and your market?

How has it changed? Hint, it will.

Experience is useful to pattern match, however, the ability to learn and adapt is what sets research practitioners apart.

By understanding what areas you want to validate it applies a lens for selecting the right research methodology.

## Validating Assumptions

I was chatting with a friend the other day who made a great point about Confirmation Bias.

In research, it is important to separate internal opinions from the objective truths of your market. Think about the whole context of what you are learning and deconstruct your assumptions. In summary, no cherry-picking.

## Qualitative Research - A Perspective

While there is so much out there to learn on Quantitative research, I will mainly focus on Qualitative Research in this post.

These are deeper type of interviews, more focused on discovery and open-ended questions.

I have found that Qualitative research is a useful way to further align the overlap between Product Marketing and Product Management. 

**Generative** research involves looking to the external market for trends and themes to drive innovation and new solutions. This is generally led by Product Marketing.

**Evaluative** research focuses on testing the existing solution to see if it meets user’s needs, is simple to use and gets the job done. This is generally led by Product Management.

Both continue forward as a collaboration. If you are a small team, there is no reason that both teams can’t participate in both types of Qual research. Though, it is important to clarify who drives what type of research forward.

## A few closing tips in The Quest for Customer Knowledge

Once you have aligned your questions/assumptions…. 

- Experiment with different formats, Win/Loss Interviews, 1:1, 1:Many - the goal is to learn something. Double-down on the format that works best for your business and customer

- Do it with a customer-centric lens. If participants understand you are asking questions with the intention of helping, then it makes for a more relaxed conversation

- Stay cool - you may get some fiery and harsh input at times. Don’t debate, just keep collecting the data

- Prioritise - set the time for research in your calendar

- Don’t just keep insights as a nice to know. Once you find a trend, do something with it. Make a business case, change your personas, or tweak your messaging. Learn…. and then adapt
