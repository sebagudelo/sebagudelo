## What is Product Marketing?

I have come across a few different definitions, and [Product Marketing Alliance](https://productmarketingalliance.com/) covers it well.

> "Done right, product marketing:

> - Represents the voice of the customer - before, during and after (product) launch,

> - Clearly articulates a product’s value in a way that resonates with the market, and

> - Drives product adoption and advocacy."

## Why Product Marketing matters?

With so many products coming to market, whether your business model is SaaS, Marketplace or Ecommerce - differentiation will get more and more challenging, due to saturation. How you position and tell your product story and iterate on that from customer feedback will be table stakes. Or, as I put it:

> "Positioning and storytelling is one of the keys to differentiation and the antidote for market saturation."

Product Marketing, done right, can be the ultimate silo-breaker for teams working separately and not focusing on the customer. Less relevant while you are a small team. However, once you grow, having the link between, Product and Marketing / Customer Facing teams is super important. It keeps everyone on the same page to drive the best customer experience right through the funnel.

Product Led-Growth is all the rage right now - and the main output for all of this is organic growth rate. The fastest growing companies of the future will have the most efficient organic growth rates. This will be driven by a remarkable product (time-to-value), combined with a compelling story that sticks, while truly understanding the market and adapting to how quickly it changes. Product Marketing plays a key role here.

## What is important to get right in Product Marketing?

I have read lots of things about the overlap between Product Manager (PM) and Product Marketing Manager (PMM).

From my experience, so far, finding the right balance breaks down to 3 key areas:

**1) Understanding & Communication**

Our program mentor, [Harvey Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harvey-lee-0328741b/), Product Marketing & Innovation Director, Avast shares some valuable principles, in that:

> "Product Management & Product Marketing are two sides of the same coin…. and the negotiated overlap is vitally important to get right early on."

Adding to this, one thing that has worked well for me is writing up a doc in Confluence defining Product Marketing. I have been applying the story-telling craft to my role as PMM and then taking that message to internal teams and iterating based on feedback. The beginning of good collaboration is understanding each other’s world and communicating effectively.

**2) Being present & helpful**

What has worked well for me is getting face time with the Product Team, (either in person, or remote). Joining along on sprint reviews, milestone planning. This helps you understand the roadmap and gets you speaking fluent PM language. This is the key to getting involved earlier in the product development cycle. Just by being present and helpful, there are inevitable opportunities for Product Marketers to take the ball and add value earlier in the product lifecycle.

**3) Adding value**

[Marcus Andrews](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusandrews), Director of Product Marketing, Pendo.io shares a gem of an insight:

> "Product Management owns the problem that gets solved for the customer, while Product Marketing should be expert & owner of the market, understanding the trends, competitor activity and how customers are feeling about market changes."

I think this is spot on and a huge opportunity for Product Marketers to drive proactive value in the Product Development cycle. Market insights with the right timing can make a huge difference.
