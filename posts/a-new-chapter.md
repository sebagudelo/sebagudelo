## I'm back

Itâ€™s great to be back writing again. Working in Product Marketing & Growth for startups since 2020 has been quite a ride. The last few months were particularly intense. Working all hours and I didnâ€™t prioritise writing for myself.

Having just finished up at my last startup gig, I have now taken a few weeks for rest and some self-work. Started a few days of a Vipassana meditation retreat, before testing positive for COVID and then entering self-isolation for 14 days.

The symptoms are clearing now and with a fresh mind it's time for a new chapter - both for writing and career. 

## Whatâ€™s been happening, whatâ€™s next?

Firstly, you will notice that I am no longer writing from Tech,Life,Travels and Substack.

I decided to build my own site last year[sebagudelo.com](https://sebagudelo.com/).

The initial theme of this site will be **How Products Grow**. I will explore how teams grow products from inception to launch.

In October last year, I studied with [Code.Sydney](https://www.code.sydney/). We did the [Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) via Udemy.

Here is a pic with how we kicked off:

I had previously worked through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): HTML, CSS and basic Javascript. React is a modern Javascript library to build user interfaces and it was great to learn the basics.

From this course, I bridged across to a Next.js starter course and built [sebagudelo.com](https://sebagudelo.com/).

**Tools I used:** 

- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-au): Domain purchase
- [Google Suite](https://workspace.google.com/): Email
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app): starter course
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Hosting and deployment
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/): Icons
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/): Design, images and resizing  
- [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/): Signup Form + Email
- [Split Bee](https://splitbee.io/): Analytics

The site started off (and still is) very basic. My own little corner of the internet, which I launched, then struggled withâ€¦ and continue to struggle with. I keep adding little features each few weeks to keep learning. Many times, I reflect that life would be so much easier using a no code platform ðŸ˜… - then I make a breakthrough and learn how to fix my own problems. 


Now you may wonder why a Product Marketer is so interested in code? My wife and friends have asked me the same question. 

I have been messing around with code since 2017 and have been working directly with software engineers since 2020. What I have learned about myself is that I love the creation process of making a product. It becomes all worth it to create a product, rather than to just consume one.

Those that know me best, know my long history with music and playing in bands - small groups of musicians that make songs. The songs are products of our exploration, synthesis and expression. Through the years, I have found I am not always the creative spark behind starting a song. I enjoy exploring and refining from the spark stage to the launch. Working with bands has been some of the happiest times of my life. A cross-functional product team reminds me of this same dynamic.

I have decided to apply this creativity to my passion for digital products. After some soul-searching, I will be embarking on my next chapter of Product Management. 

## Why Product Management?

This is the most important question. I ask myself often whenever embarking on a new venture.

I have spent much of my 20s and early 30s chasing external motivators (money, titles, promotions).

As I reach my mid-30s, I am now looking for something that is calling me from within, rather than me just chasing it.

In 2016, I first entered Customer Success/Account Management for my love of building customer relationships and helping solve customer problems.

In 2020, I explored creating my own venture in the [Antler](https://www.antler.co/) program. 

In 2021, I played a Product co-pilot role as a Product Marketing Manager in some startups. This got me close to Product teams and opened my eyes to the possibilities.

I did some future visualisation. As a Product Marketing Manager, the pinnacle of a career could be creating an amazing strategy and launch that delivers triple-digit growth. This strategy could reach millions of people through many high-visibility channels. It looked great in my visualisation and an amazing business outcome, but it didnâ€™t feel like me.

I did the same visualisation as a Product Manager, the pinnacle of a career could be creating an amazing product with a talented product team, which then gets used by millions of customers. This felt like me. The longevity of a solution to a customer problem makes me feel proud. I have realised I get a warm feeling in my stomach and heart when I think about it. Iâ€™m letting this feeling pull me towards it.


## How?

Well, here comes the fun part! Andâ€¦ the scary part, because I know it wonâ€™t be easy. Iâ€™m grateful for the strong belief of my family and friends around me.

Here's the steps:

**Theory**

- Lotâ€™s of [reading](https://productschool.com/blog/product-management-2/how-to-become-2/top-most-read-books-by-product-managers/)

- Planning: Highly recommend [Diego Granados](https://www.pmdiego.com/) - he has such detailed content for Product Management, and actionable steps that anyone can follow. 

- I'm fortunate to be attending [Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/) this year. I will be completing Product Management Fundamentals in the US Spring Cohort. While listening to a Fireside chat with Brian Balfour, Reforge Founder, he shared a great piece of advice for when you are crossing the river rapids of a career transition. The worst thing you can do is tread water. The key is to set your eyes towards the shore on the other side and swim. Itâ€™s time to swim.

**Practice**

- I was stoked to be accepted into [Co.Lab](https://www.joincolab.io/) program - Cohort 10. What makes this program unique is that I will be a PM within a cross-functional team along with a Designer and 2 x Developers. Together we will discover, build and launch a product over 8 weeks.

- I'll also be helping [Code Sydney](https://www.code.sydney/) build out Product Management practices within some of their projects.

There will be plenty to keep me busy over the coming weeks. 

Iâ€™ll be sharing some updates as we build and I experience this new chapter.

If you have any questions or are interested in a tech career donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any questions. I am happy to share everything I learn.
