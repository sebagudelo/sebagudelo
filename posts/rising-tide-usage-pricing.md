SaaS pricing is an art and a science.

Pricing done well can accelerate growth and drive product adoption. Done poorly, it creates friction in the funnel, and can lead to churn later on.

In a Sales-led motion, some of the most successful SaaS businesses have led with brand, events and compelling customer stories at the top of funnel. While then proposing [value based pricing](https://hbr.org/2016/08/a-quick-guide-to-value-based-pricing) as it gets deeper into the sales cycle.

Once a sales process kicks off, multiple meetings occur before a solution is scoped and pricing is, eventually, presented to a buyer.

While value based pricing will still exist with highly customised solutions, I am observing a rising tide that many SaaS companies will introduce more transparent usage-based pricing as part of their offerings, to get customers started.

## The Case for Usage & Consumption Based Pricing

A usage-based pricing model is a service provision and payment in which the customer pays according to the resources used.

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/au/pricing#pricing-details) is a good example of what this looks like in practice.

While they still have customised options for a Sales based approach, there is a usage-based pricing option that you can get started with very quickly.

From a SaaS perspective, [Kyle Poyar](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/), partner at [OpenView](https://openviewpartners.com/), makes a compelling case explaining why many of the most successful SaaS businesses like: Twilio, AWS, Stripe and Snowflake offering are winning in the market with usage-based pricing.

> "The usage-based model allows a customer to start at a low cost, minimizing friction to getting started while still preserving the ability to monetize a customer over time because the price is directly tied with the value a customer receives.”

Kyle makes many other interesting points through his [Growth Unhinged](https://kylepoyar.substack.com/p/usage-based-pricing-20) newsletter. Well worth a read.

A key principle is preserving the balance of price and value while usage increases. If the scale falls out of balance this is where problems occur. The scale that stays in balance gets customer compound interest over time.

## Buyers Point of View

My own perspectives on this come after many years in SaaS and now experiencing life on the client side as a Product Marketer, and a buyer of SaaS products.

Having experienced both sides of the fence, here are some of my first hand experiences on why Usage Based pricing makes sense from a buyer’s perspective and things to consider:

- Usage-based pricing makes it easier to try something out and have fun using new tech. Life is short and it is good to learn new things that can quickly and elegantly solve a problem

- Testing allows you to show your boss what a product does. Not just what it says it does. Matching brand positioning with product experience becomes a reality with usage-based pricing

- Scale up and scale down, based on business needs. This defines flexibility and makes a lot of sense for seasonal business or for any business with demand fluctuations

- Minimising waste - It is more sustainable. Who wants to pay 100% of the cost for something that they use 60% of the time? This is a secret of every subscription business model from SaaS to Gym Memberships. However, as consumers, I think we are beginning to pick it apart.

- With usage-based pricing, reporting and alerts are super important in a product. Making sure customers understand the levers of what drives cost and how the reporting works is key

I have read lots of things about the overlap between Product Manager (PM) and Product Marketing Manager (PMM). From my experience, so far, finding the right balance breaks down to 3 key areas:

## Future SaaS Pricing

It is interesting to imagine the types of pricing schemes that may emerge in the future and not just around usage-based pricing.

1. Communities - group pricing models. Still usage-based and offering higher tiers, and special rates, incentivising multiple users at the same time. There is a lot of value that can be unlocked by a group of users using the same product and building at the same time. This is the foundation of any great product community

2. Transfer of credits mid-service term. Imagine a StubHub marketplace for companies to resell SaaS services that they are no longer using. While this could lead to a lost customer, it could mean additional spend in another customer, or even a new customer

3. Dynamic Pricing. Super applicable to Ecommerce and Travel, how could this apply in SaaS?

Pricing is fascinating and with more software being created everyday, I am super interested to see what is to come and the influence Product Marketers will have on customer focused pricing models.
