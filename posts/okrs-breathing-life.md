How do you get true alignment in your team?

How do you stay focused on the goals that matter?

These are the questions that are easy to ask but harder to answer.

OKRs are not a new concept and there is so much content about them, but why are they so hard to nail?

Let’s cover a brief definition, and then get some insights from an expert, while [breathing life into a corporate acronym.](https://review.firstround.com/How-to-Make-OKRs-Actually-Work-at-Your-Startup)

## What is an OKR?

> “The definition of “OKRs” is “Objectives and Key Results.” It is a collaborative goal-setting tool used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results.”

[Ryan Panchadsaram + Sam Prince](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example/)

Here are some of the companies that use them as part of their operating rhythm:

## Insights from an expert

I asked Bo Pedersen, Chief Strategy Officer, GTMHub and Partner, Charlotte Street Capital, a couple of the key things that matter:

**Q: What is the one thing teams get wrong about OKRs?**

> A: "Lack of Executive Buy-In. OKRs place many demands on an organisation, and there will almost certainly be setbacks along the way.

In order to overcome the challenges introduced by OKRs, it is important to gain full executive buy-in. In most organisations, this means that the CEO must be fully behind the decision to implement OKRs to realise the full value."

**Q: What is the most important thing to get right with OKRs (think 80/20 Pareto's law)?**

> A: "Start with why. Just like Simon Sinek's famous method for inspiring people to take action, OKRs are nothing without a great reason why.

What do you want to achieve? What is the ultimate goal? The example from the 1960s space race is the publicly stated goal by John F. Kennedy to "put a man on the moon before the end of the decade.”

This simply stated goal allowed an organisation of 300,000+ engineers and scientists to focus and break down the challenge into smaller chunks.”

## It’s not just about the metrics

This insight from Bo got me thinking that clarity on purpose is what matters the most for OKRs.

When the mission is clear, OKRs can truly be helpful to use as a compass to guide the way.

At this point, while the top down buy-in of OKRs is important, there is also a bottom up pull of teams wanting to own the OKRs to contribute to the overarching goal.

This then becomes a question of motivation.

Days become weeks, weeks become months, months become years.

Time passes oh-so fast.

Unless there is a purpose, OKRs risk just staying as a tick-in-the-box corporate acronym that only get looked at once a year at annual performance reviews.
