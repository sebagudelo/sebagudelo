When was the last time you bought a digital subscription product? It doesn’t matter if it was a content streaming service, a product to launch your side hustle, or even a monthly newsletter to your favourite writer. We have all been there before. 

It can go something like this:  

- Casual browsing

- Reading about a novel product

- Hitting their site

- Figuring out what a product or service does

- Exploring pricing, sizing up a monthly cost

- Discovering a free trial 

- Asking yourself, would I really use this?

- And then thinking, why not give it a try?

As consumers, we make a quick decision to sign up to a product that fulfils a need, or that solves a problem in a way we relate to. It is easy to sign up and lots of offerings have a freemium model, or a free trial, which makes it even more tempting. 

The way we buy consumer SaaS at home is blending with how we buy B2B SaaS products at work. This shift in buying behaviour focuses on direct user problems. It will introduce more Product-Led Companies and will introduce more opportunities for Product Marketers to expand their craft, while driving business impact. Let’s explore some of the opportunities we will see now and into the future.

## A Product-Led future

To meet this user driven buying behaviour, SaaS companies are quickly adopting Product-Led Growth (PLG). This means using their product as the primary method of acquiring, retaining and expanding users. [Tomas Tunguz](https://tomtunguz.com/2021-predictions/), a leading SaaS VC, predicts that 2021 will be the year that PLG becomes the standard go-to market approach for SaaS companies, thus driving it towards mass-adoption.

Influencing of C-Level buyers will still need to happen for enterprise SaaS deals. Both in complex commercial negotiations and in tried and true ways of thought leadership and case studies. However, increasingly, the deal velocity will come from the internal influence of the user that is hands on and needs to extract value from the technology investment. 

Users will become the internal advisors of the C-Level buyers to help decide where the budget is spent. Fully adopted products that join a company’s tech stack will become resume features for users and their playbooks for future career progression. Users and buyers will place their bets wisely like portfolio managers looking for growth and potential.

[Todd Olsen](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Driven-Product-Software-Customers-Without/dp/1119660874), CEO & Founder, Pendo, shares an important perspective that PLG is simply a by-product of being a Product-Led company. Fundamentally, Product-Led companies share a mindset that a product is not something that is just sold. A product is a user’s first moment of truth and the primary driver of a remarkable experience that can then get shared with others, driving the [Natural Rate of Growth](https://visible.vc/blog/natural-rate-of-growth-template/).

To see the commercial value of great product experiences, look no further than some of the top performing public companies listed in [Openview’s PLG Index](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/how-to-tell-product-led/#.YM233zYza3I) - with Product-Led companies trading at a 50% revenue premium compared to their peers in the SaaS industry. 

Retention will becomes table-stakes for Product Marketers

So, what will this mean for Product Marketers? We understand how easy it is for a user to sign up. However, as quickly as they sign up, a user can easily lose interest. [Blissfully](https://www.blissfully.com/blog/saas-statistics/) states that companies use 137 SaaS products on average and churn through 30% of them per year. 

In Ramli John’s book [Product-Led Onboarding](https://www.amazon.com/Product-Led-Onboarding-Users-Lifelong-Customers/dp/1777717701/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=product-led+onboarding&qid=1624098543&sr=8-1), it is stated that 40-60% of users will sign up for a SaaS product and then never come back. This is a frightening reality for any Product Manager or Product Marketing Manager to read and shows that users have a shorter attention span than ever. There is a greater amount of choice of different SaaS products and a limited time to invest in them.

In a Product-Led world, SaaS products are tested before being truly adopted. Users can sign up for multiple products at once. Users not only want to use the best products that will drive meaningful results. They want to feel that a Product delivers an experience that truly meets their needs as a user.

As a result, the role of a Product Marketer will expand even deeper in the funnel. Especially, across onboarding, activation and retention. A sign up will be a positive indicator of a product’s positioning and messaging. It will be just a ticket to the game for SaaS products. 

The real moment of truth will be whether an activation occurs and if the user receives value once they sign up. This will determine if all the promises made in acquiring the user, match a user’s reality when they first encounter the product. Unless there is a genuine heartfelt need felt by the user as they experience a product, it is easier than ever for a user to just become dormant and churn.

Brian Balfour, Casey Winters and Shawn Clowes at [Reforge](https://www.reforge.com/blog/retention-engagement-growth-silent-killer) paint a stark reality for tech companies with significant user acquisition growth rates, and the difference that churn rate makes to monthly active user growth over time.

It will be a deep collaboration between Product Management and Product Marketing teams to understand the leading indicators of churn and how to act fast in a short window of opportunity that exists after a sign up.

## Product & Community Enablement will overtake Sales Enablement

For Product Marketers much time and resource has gone into producing sales collateral, pitch decks, battle cards and training for internal teams to take products to market. I have experienced both producing this content as a marketer and receiving this as a sales rep. 

While Sales Enablement will rightfully have its place for large value deals in enterprise companies. For the Product Marketer, this type of approach is still an indirect distribution of value. The Product Marketer enables the Sales team with content, who then share the content on to the users through meetings and follow-up emails.   

In Product-Led Companies revenue is made from low value deals, which grow over time due to usage and adoption. The Product becomes the Sales Rep for the first parts of the user journey and the Customer Success Manager for deeper parts of the user journey. The distribution of the value is direct. The user has all the content they need freely available to them without speaking to anyone from the SaaS company. 

A shift to Product Enablement will be focused on educating users about the problem and the product. Helping them learn about the problem they have, why it is worth solving in the first place and how their industry peers are getting ahead. The direct distribution of content will mean that all Product Marketing resources expended will be measured and iterated upon quickly with feedback loops within the product.

There is a unique opportunity for Product Marketers to get closer with their Product teams, while taking the lead in Product Enablement to educate users. Product Marketers will also increasingly partner with Customer Success and Support teams and alley-oop each other to deliver great customer experiences for key accounts both within and outside of the product. For high volume, repetitive and low stakes touch points the secrets of scale will be to find ways to deliver self-serve, in a personal way.

While product documentation will always continue to be  helpful in SaaS, the merging of Product Documentation with interactive, pre-produced templates, and videos to educate, show and guide users along the way will be the future. Learning a new product should be fun for users and it will be a Product Marketers job to help deliver that experience.

The value of Product Enablement will be amplified and informed by a strong user community. [Patrick Woods](https://future.a16z.com/community-%E2%89%A0-marketing-why-we-need-go-to-community-not-just-go-to-market/), CEO Orbit, refers to this as Community-Led Growth and sums it up perfectly:

> “The conversations, content, and connection that emerge from a community reveal what matters to them, what they struggle with, what they need to be successful, and what matters in their world. If you’re paying attention to the community and talking to the folks in it, you’ll have a clear point of view that can empower others within your company to act with conviction and clarity.”

## Product Marketing taking more ownership of Growth and Distribution

Alexander Becker and Product Marketing Alliance provide a great prediction in their Product Marketing Field Guide that the traditional lines between Product Marketing and Growth marketing will blur. SaaS companies in lower-touch GTM models, will need to become increasingly data-driven to test, learn and make better customer decisions.

[Elena Verna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiLoYre2GHQ) gives an exceptional talk with Netlify where she defines that Growth is the science of achieving maximum distribution of a product, while a framework is the different levers that can be pulled across Acquisition, Retention and Monetization to achieve the distribution. 

For Product Marketers to truly get a seat at the table for strategic Product Conversations, not only will they need to bring the quantified insight from the market, they will need to take accountability for achieving the maximum product distribution, crafting distribution hypotheses and testing that they work. 

For smaller Product-Led companies, I predict that Growth will not need to be a separate team for Marketing related experiments. As Product Marketers get deeper in the funnel, experimentation will be a subset of any improvements to a user’s product experience in acquisition, onboarding, activation and retention. This is a key opportunity for Product Marketing to truly drive product distribution and adoption.

For larger Product-Led companies that begin to scale, a Growth Product Management team can then be formed to lead experimentation, with dedicated engineering resources. [Anthony Murphy](https://productcoalition.com/difference-between-product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-growth-pm-3aef15cb5b18?gi=3bb03a9fc7ed) provides some more context on the intersection of Growth Product Managers, Core Product Managers and Product Marketing and how this will continue to evolve.

## The Double-Edged Sword of an Open SaaS Product

With a highly accessible SaaS product and transparent pricing, a double-edged sword is formed. As a Product Marketer it becomes much easier to conduct Competitor Research by visiting a competitor’s site, reviewing pricing, messaging, case studies, and using a competitor's product to experience it first hand. The double-edge is that this can also be done for your own product. This increased visibility introduces both risk and opportunity to a SaaS business. 

As Product Marketers at Product-Led companies, Competitor Research will be something that we remain responsible for. There will be no shortage of information and the true skill will be in identifying the trends and opportunities for creating more customer value. 

Product Marketers will need to not lose sight of being competitor informed, while being customer obsessed. In a highly competitive SaaS industry, it will be more important than ever to remember that it is not a zero sum game. Our focus as Product-Led companies and Product Marketers, should be on the creation of new value for customers, not taking it away. A rising tide will continue to raise all the boats and create better products as a result.

## Product Marketing becomes builders of Content Products

Just as Product Managers create products that solve user problems, Product Marketers will create content that solves user problems. For Product Marketers, Content Products will emerge with a life cycle of their own. From Concept Development, to Growth, to Maturity and Decline, all the stages of the Product Life Cycle will apply to Content Products. New content pieces can then be managed in an agile backlog of their own.

As an example of a new Content Product, let’s use a Designer User Story for a [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) customer. As a Loom user, I want to embed mockup demo videos in my Confluence space so that the rest of the team can see the videos without leaving [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence).  To achieve this use case, Product teams from both companies would need to work on the technical integration.

The resulting Content Product from this integration would be the Loom and Confluence Product Marketing teams working together to create stories, use cases and content to bring it all together for Loom and Confluence customers. Many SaaS companies just focus on their own universe, however, Product Marketers will need to lead in changing this mindset and in communicating a solution greater than the sum of its parts.

It will be an exciting time to be a Product Marketer and these are only some of the opportunities that await as we move to a Product-Led future. Looking forward to riding this wave into the 20s and beyond.
