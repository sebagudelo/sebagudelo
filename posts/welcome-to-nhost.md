Exciting times last week as I kicked off as Head of Growth for [Nhost](https://nhost.io).

It’s going to be a ride building Growth zero to one and I will continue to share the journey as we go.

## About Nhost

Nhost is pronounced en-host and is Swedish for ‘a host’.

We are on a mission to help Developers to become Product Builders.

We believe that developers have the unique skills to build the world’s best digital products, especially when every company is becoming a software company.

When launching a web or mobile app, it is easy for Developers to get stuck solving infrastructure problems that don’t have a direct impact on the product. This can quickly turn into technical debt.

By working with a serverless backend like Nhost, it frees up Developers to focus on the front end experiences that differentiate and deliver the most value for users. 

Hasura GraphQL, Postgres database, Storage, Authentication and Serverless Functions are all curated and managed by Nhost, with a focus on developer experience.

## Here are just some of the reasons why I decided to join the Nhost team:

**Founder/Head of Growth Fit**

Meeting with Johan and Nuno it was clear they have a deep understanding of the developer tools space and a strong vision to build a meaningful company. Given my experience in across the full customer journey in SaaS: Marketing, Sales and Customer Success we complement each other well.

We jammed on books, podcasts and David Goggins. We also both experienced the [Antler](https://www.antler.co/) program in Sweden and Sydney respectively and it is great to be back in the community.

**Product-Led Creativity**

Engineering and Design talent. The team is brimming with talent and as a Marketer it is exciting to collaborate in this creative environment.

**Globally remote**

Every team member of Nhost is from a different country. We like to say we are on The Internet. Though, our homes are in: Sweden, Azores, India, Finland, Germany, Argentina and Australia.

**Strong User Advocacy**

We had our first community call last week with many developers from around the world and all of them love to build on the Nhost platform. With 3000+ developers already signed up and 100+ paying customers, we have an opportunity to build a fantastic community of product builders supporting each other’s projects.
